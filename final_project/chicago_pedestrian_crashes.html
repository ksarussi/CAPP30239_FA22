    <p> Crash data comes from the electronic crash reporting system ("E-Crash") from the Chicago Police Department. Although 
        some E-Crash data is first available starting in 2015, citywide data did not become available until September 2017, which explains
        the steep increase in reported crashes in September 2017. </p>

    <p> The number of pedestrians hit by vehicles declined as the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020. 
        The lowest number of crashes in one month occurred in April 2020.
        Since early 2021, the number of pedestrians hit has trended towards pre-pandemic averages.

    <p> "Reported, Non-evident" are any injuries not included in the other categories, or are injuries that are not visible/evident.
        This may include "momentary unconsciousness, claims of injuries not evident, limping, complaints of pain, nausea, hysteria"</p>
    <div>    
        <p>"Non-incapacitating" refers to any injuries that are not classified as fatal or incapacitating and are evident at the scene of the crash.
        This may include "lumps on the head, abrasions, bruises, minor lacerations."
    </p>
    
    <p>"Incapacitating" refers to any injuries "which prevents the injured person from walking, driving, or normally continuing the activities" that
        were possible before the crash occurred.

        <p> The city of Chicago has a "Fatal Crash Response Coordination Committee" and uses a process to determine whether a 
            death is a "traffic fatality" for the purposes of Vision Zero Chicago (an initiative created with the 
            goal of zero traffic deaths in Chicago). I choose to display the number of pedestrian fatalities as 
            defined by the FCRCC. This number may thus represent an underestimate of total pedestrian fatalities over time
            due to the narrow definition of "traffic fatality" by the FCRCC." </p>
