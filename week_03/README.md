# WEEK 3

## In class-exercises and projects
This week's folder contains examples we worked on in class and data used for examples, and a homework assignment related to creating a bar chart. 

The files used for exercises in-class learning include the following:
- index.html
- script.js
- covid.csv

The files used to create a bar chart showing library visits include the following:
- homework.html
- homework.js
- library_visits_jan22.csv

## Data for Final Project
Currently, the primary datasets I am planning on using for my project are too large to be uploaded to Github. The csv files can be found at the following link: https://uchicago.box.com/s/33wcyp3e3ton78tfmyeq4r0q1k5yjrg0

### Data Source:
- Title: Traffic Crashes, including Crashes, Vehicles, and People
- Agency: City of Chicago
- Location: Chicago
- Link: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if

### Data Description:
The data includes crash data on each traffic crash on city streets under the jurisdiction of the Chicago Police Department. Records come from electronic crash reporting system and are available citywide starting in September 2017. Data are self-reported at the police district, or recorded at the scene by a responding police officer. There are three main datasets that can be used in conjunction: one dataset regarding the overall crash, one dataset with information on the vehicles involved in the crash, and one dataset with information on any pedestrians involved in the crash. 

### Why Interested: 
I'm interested in understanding patterns related to traffic violence as it relates to public safety in Chicago. So far in 2022, there have been 22 pedestrian fatality cases, eight bicyclist fatality cases, and many other crashes resulting in injuries in the city. The primary goal of this visualization will be to add to the conversation on how the city prioritizes people's ability to get around the city safely, and how the city thinks about creating infrastructure that considers more than just the needs of motorists.

#### Thoughts on how it will be used and potential data points (goals):
The primary goal will be to create visuals showing crash trends over time, and where, when, and who are involved in these crashes. 

    - analyze number of pedestrian-involved or bicycle-involved crashes over time since 2017
    - analyze what type of infrastructure existed near the spot where the crash occurred at the time (such as type of bike lane, traffic light, crosswalk)
    - identify most problematic streets/intersections
    - compare crash trends by neighborhood or zipcode and per-capita numbers
    - analyze types of crashes (injuries, type of crash such as "dooring")
    - others will be added as additional data fields are considered

#### Concerns on data quality:
    - Only data since 2017 includes all police districts, although the dataset begins in 2015.
    - Formal crash datasets released by the Illinois Dept Of Transportation may    differ from this dataset, so the way "crashes" are being defined needs to be considered when doing any analysis 
    - ~ half of crashes are self-reported
    - not all crashes may be included in the dataset at teh time of download, possibly due to lag in udpating of the data or miscategorization of the type of crash 

#### Type of data
