## Explanation of Cleaned Data Files

## 3 Main Datasets:
These datasets are the primary datasets I will be using to create my charts. THey are large because they contain each crash, vehicle, or person that is involved in a crash in Chicago every day since 2017. They contain demographic details, and other variables ranging from injuries to where the crash occured. I have not broken them into smaller subsets at this point because I do not know exactly what charts I will be making. I will create smaller .csv files from these depending on what charts I make.

1. Crashes-Clean.csv
2. Crashes-people-Clean.csv
3. Crashes-Vehicles-Clean.csv

## Examples of the three datasets above already filtered/aggregated
The following datasets are created by aggregating data in the three datasets listed above. They are examples of what the smaller csv files will look like depending on what graphs I end up making. I may use these for charts or end up aggregating the data in additional/different ways going forward. There will likely be additional datasets listed here later.

1. annual_cyclist_crashes.csv
2. annual_pedestrian_crashes.csv
3. cyclist_crashes_by_injury.csv
4. pedestrian_crashes_by_injury.csv

## Additional files
The remaining folder includes all files relevant/necessary to plot the boundaries of Chicago neighborhoods and cannot be collapsed.
